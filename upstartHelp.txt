You may also want to consider using the upstart utility. 
It will allow you to start, stop and restart you node application like a service. 
Upstart can configured to automatically restart your application if it crashes.

Install upstart:

sudo apt-get install upstart
Create a simple script for your application that will look something like:

#!upstart
description "my app"

start on started mountall
stop on shutdown

# Automatically Respawn:
respawn
respawn limit 99 5

env NODE_ENV=production

exec node /somepath/myapp/app.js >> /var/log/myapp.log 2>&1
Then copy the script file (myapp.conf) to /etc/init and make sure its marked as executable. 
Your application can then be managed using the following commands:

sudo start myapp
sudo stop myapp
sudo restart myapp
